Oblitus Casa version 2.0.2 is now out!

This version of the game should FULLY fix tunnels for people with integrated GPUS! If you had any problems with tunnels freezing or deloading, Go to options and enable the "Reduced Tunnels" Setting, this will sacrifice some visual detail by having things pop out of frame easier, but this will make it so you can finally play the coolest part of the game!
