Oblitus Casa 2.0 is now released!

This version of the game will not carry over your old save file due to possible save file manipulation to abuse conversion, and the fact that the game is now vastly different in its mechanics that you should replay it in its entirety. One major change is the new luring system, you must now lure directly next to a character to lure them instead of across the map. The lure system is also different in that each camera has its own lure amount, and it does not replenish.

Now for the tunnels, Tunnels has been changed greatly since the original versions of casa. This new version of tunnels features Pseudo-3D, 2D animations in attempt to immitate 3D, It is very intensive when loading assets so you may experience lag walking through a corridor for the first time. This section of the game is super technical and may have weird glitchiness in it. If you happen to notice this happening, please report this to the gamepage so it can be fixed.
