Oblitus Casa 2.0 is now released!

Go away steals

This version of the game will not carry over your old save file due to possible save file manipulation to abuse conversion, and the fact that the game is now vastly different in its mechanics that you should replay it in its entirety. One major change is the new luring system, you must now lure directly next to a character to lure them instead of across the map. The lure system is also different in that each camera has its own lure amount, and it does not replenish.
