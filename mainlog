Oblitus Casa version 2.0.4 is now out!

(If your game says it's out of date, that is because jeff monitor getting stuck has been fixed + All white stars will unlock mortimer in the extras alongside seeing him ingame.)

(A screen will now pop up warning you if you have too little dedicated ram. Credit to Yunivers for collaborating with me to get this functionality working. If it falsely detects you as having less than 5.0 gb of VRAM, then you can disable this option.)
